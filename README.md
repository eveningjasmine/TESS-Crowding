# TESS-Crowding
Measure rotation periods for a large number of stars in crowded open clusters using TESS

In this repository you will find an example for how to make light curves from TESS FFIs and how to analyze these light curves in crowded environments (make_lightcurve.ipynb). 

You will also find a comprehensive rotational analysis of the crowded cluster NGC 3532 (crowding_analysis.ipynb).
